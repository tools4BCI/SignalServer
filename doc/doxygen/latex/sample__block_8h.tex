\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
sample\_\-block is designed to store and sort samples directly acquired from hardware devices. A \hyperlink{class_sample_block}{SampleBlock} stores samples, directly acquired from hardware devices in ascending order to their signal types. It can store blocked data directly by giving a already block oriented sample vector or by appending block by block to a \hyperlink{class_sample_block}{SampleBlock}. Blocksize and number of channels to store in a \hyperlink{class_sample_block}{SampleBlock} have to be
