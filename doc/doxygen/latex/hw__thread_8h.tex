\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
hw\_\-thread is a base class for all hardware objects ( -\/-\/ bad naming -\/-\/$>$ object does not have to run in a thread) hw\_\-thread provides a base class for all hardware objects to allow consistent access to different types of hardware. REMARK: The naming \char`\"{}hw\_\-thread\char`\"{} was badly chosen, as it was planned at the beginning, to run every hardware object in it's own thread. Using synchronous and asynchronous data access, this is not needed all the time. File and class name are planned to be renamed in the future! (e.g. hw\_\-base)
