\textbf{Ideas for testing the TOBI signalserver concerning CPU load:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Measuring CPU time of the process without any additional workload
  \item Measuring CPU time of the process with heavy additional cpu power consuming workload (e.g. using CPU BurnIn)
  \item Measuring CPU time of the process with additional workload for the harddisk
  \item Comparing, how an increased number of channels or an increased samplingrate affects the cpu usage\\
        \hspace*{0.4cm}(don't use the software sinegenerator!\\
        \hspace*{0.5cm}\dots some additional features might have to be implemented for this test)
  \\
  \item A timestamp is available in the DataPacket. Logging the timestamp should produce a quite linear curve, what happens by increasing the workload?
  \\
  \item If possible:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Logging the cpu workload curve for the process and searching for points with increased cpu usage\\
          \hspace*{0.4cm}(don't use the sinegenerator!
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{1cm}
What happens, if the process is not fast enought?
