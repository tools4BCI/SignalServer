Hardware Requirements
=====================

- CPU: at least 200 MHz (already tested on embedded systems)
  (highly dependent on sampling rate and number of acquired channels)
- RAM: 32 MB

- Run the Signal Server with highest process priority

For networking usage:

- Ethernet min. 100 MBit (1 GBit recommended)

  (needed network connection varying by the sampling rate and the number of channels acquired)
