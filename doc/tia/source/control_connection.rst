Control Connection
==================

A TiA server has to provide a TCP port on which clients can create a control connection.
Each client gets its own control connection to the server.

The control connection can be used by the clients to send requests to the server such as
"start/stop data transmission".

Each message which is send from the client to the server or vice versa is structured as followed:

* Version line
* Command line
* Optional content description line
* Empty lines
* Optional xml content


Remarks:

* The protocol is in the style of HTTP
* The message is split into lines which are terminated by the 0x0A character (also known as ``\n``, line feed or <LF>)
* Some messages contain additional XML-structured content which is UTF-8 encoded
* All characters are case sensitive!


Server Commands
---------------

A TiA 1.0 server implementation has to support the following commands:

* Get config
* Get data connection
* Start data transmission
* Stop data transmission


Get Config
^^^^^^^^^^

This command is used to get the informations about signals from the server.

Get Data Transmission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two types of data transmissions exist: "TCP" and "UDP".
