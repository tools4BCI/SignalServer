*
*
* \section sec_intro Introduction
* TOBI Interface A (TiA) is a platform independent interface to
* transmit raw biosignals. This implementation is done using C++.
*
* TiA has the intention to allow multirate data acquisition from multiple
* sources (EEG amplifiers, EMG amplifiers, assistive devices) at the same
* time and facilitate an easy distinction afterwards. TiA provides an
* additional abstraction mechanism to mask attached hardware and reduce the
* clients burden to exactly know connected hardware.
* An (theoretically) infinite number of clients is able to connect to a TiA
* server at runtime.
*
* This library is designed to be platform independent and has already been
* ported and tested at various Linux distributions, Windows XP and Windows 7
* and also the iPhone and the iPod.
*
* Meta Information exchange is done using XML messages via a TCP connection.
* Raw data transmission is done electively using assured transmission via a
* TCP connection or unreliable transmission using broadcast UDP.
*
* Up to now TiA is used in the TOBI Signal Server. Client applications
* for Matlab or scope applications will be provided soon.
*
* \section Dependencies
* Needed libraries are:
*   - boost-libs: asio, system, date_time  (recommeneded: >=1.40)
*       (www.boost.org)
*   - ticpp  (tinyXML fpr C++)
*       (http://code.google.com/p/ticpp/)
*
* \section Recommendations
*   - Ethernet min. 100 MBit (1 GBit sugggested)
*       (needed network connection varying by the sampling rate and
*        the number of channels acquired)
*   - Run TiA with highest process priority possible
*   PC requirements:
*   - CPU: at least 200 MHz (already tested on embedded systems)
*   - RAM: 32 MB
*
*  (More detailed hardware requirements are hard to be provided, as
*    this is highly linked with the data acquisition settings)
