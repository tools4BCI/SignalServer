*
* Devices are seperated into master and slave devices, whereby only one master is allowed
* at once, all other devices have to be slaves.
* The master device sets the pace DataPackets can be acquired as it is driven in a blocking way.
* Data from all slaves is gathered with the masters speed, whereby data stored in the slaves buffer
* is returned immediately. Slaves are NOT operated in a synchronous way (method to get data from
* slaves is non-blocking).
